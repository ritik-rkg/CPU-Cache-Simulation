# CPU-Cache-Simulation
A software project that simulates the behavior of a CPU cache. The project implemented LRU as the cache replacement policy. The simulation was performed on a trace file of memory accesses and results were collected and analyzed in terms of hit rate and miss rate. It includes a graphical user interface that allows to view and analyze the results.
